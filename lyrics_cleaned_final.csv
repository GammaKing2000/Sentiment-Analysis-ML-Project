There's a forest fire burning bright Spreading quickly towards our last rites Nowhere to run, pointless to hide Just lay there and scream, pretending to try Pretending...  Intending to burn, pretending to fight it Everyone learns faster on fire Things took a turn, lost all desire You live and you burn You live and you burn  This impending doom is left deep inside And it's haunting you each and every night Like starving wolves counting sheep We close our eyes, pretending to sleep Descending...  Intending to burn, pretending to fight it Everyone learns faster on fire Things took a turn, lost all desire You live and you burn, you live and  Like hell, we are anxiously waiting Like hell, burning silently strong Somehow we fell down by the wayside And somehow this hell is home  As we burn, pretending to fight it Everyone learns faster on fire Things took a turn, lost all desire You live and you burn You live and...  Like hell, we are anxiously waiting Like hell, burning silently strong Somehow we fell down by the wayside And somehow this hell is home Right now, this hell is my home"
